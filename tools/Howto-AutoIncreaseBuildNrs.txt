AutoIncreaseBuildNrs automatically increments "VER_BUILDNR" in your source file.

How to automatically execute after each compile step within Qt Creator?
1. Open the project
2. Change to "Projects" view, or press Ctrl+5
3. Click on "Add Build Step" and choose "Custom Process Step"
4. Move up the process step right below the regular qmake step
5. As for the Command field, write "%{sourceDir}\tools\AutoIncreaseBuildNrs.exe"
6. As for the Arguments field, write "%{sourceDir}\BASE\version.h"
7. As for Working directly field, leave it to "%{buildDir}"

Do this for both Edit build configurations, "Debug" and "Release".
